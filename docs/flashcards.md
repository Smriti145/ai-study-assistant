# Flashcards

Open `/flashcards` to generate 3–20 cards from pasted notes or a completed library
document. Review the AI output, edit questions/answers, reveal an answer, and rate
recall. This is a simple interval scheduler, not a claim of scientifically measured mastery.

- Again: 10 minutes; Hard: at least 1 day; Good: at least 1 day, then double;
  Easy: at least 4 days, then triple the prior interval.
- Review/edit requests include the card version. Stale writes return 409; the web UI reloads the deck, resets the revealed answer,
  and asks you to review the current card. Other API clients should reopen the deck. Future cards cannot be reviewed early.
- Decks, cards, and review events persist in three additive tables created on startup.
- Deleting a deck also deletes its cards and reviews, including their analytics.
- All queries use the authenticated user dependency (currently shared-demo mode).

Endpoints under `/api/flashcards`: POST/GET `/decks`, GET/DELETE `/decks/{id}`,
PATCH `/cards/{id}`, POST `/cards/{id}/review`. Generation accepts `title`, `count`,
and exactly one of `text` or `document_id`. Edit accepts `front`, `back`, `version`;
review accepts `rating` (`again`, `hard`, `good`, `easy`) and `version`.
AI output must match the requested card count and contain unique, nonempty questions.

Run `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_flashcards.py'`
from backend. Live generation additionally needs a valid server-side Gemini key.

Library loading is independent from deck loading. If the library is unavailable,
pasted-note generation and saved-deck review remain available with a visible notice.
